          At age 18, I had the greatest idea to give myself a 19th birthday present after almost a year of working 40 hours at Starbucks, though they claim I was just a part-time employee, and after finally graduating high school during a miserable time around my life. Having just recently received a credit card, I decided to buy myself a plane ticket after clicking on an article about South Korea opening up its borders for tourism. Now I was already familiar with the South Korean culture and language through my Korean friends, and my students (I was an online English tutor for a while).

          Buying the plane ticket was the easy part, but the process after was quite difficult due to covid. I had to do at least 1 month of research and ask around this subreddit,

                To be able to actually enter the country, you would have to apply for an online visa and the process should, at the most, last 3 days depending on your information. After the process is done, you can print the document or download their app to acquire the qr code linked straight to the visa.

                This is where it got a bit complicated for me. Before South Korea, I was in New York for a week and a half for a family reunion alongside my family friends, and I had an overnight layover in Vancouver (I found mice lodged in between the seats there). So I had to look for a way to get myself tested for COVID, thankfully my uncle is a Doctor, and I had no need to get tested in Vancouver as I was only staying in the airport. Th Q-Code application process for this isn't long, though you do need to acquire a vast amount of <b>information:</b>

                  Since your COVID test results take a while to process, you have to time your test just right before your flight, max 2 days, and hope that you will receive your test results before you reach the border.
