          At age 18, I had the greatest idea to give myself a 19th birthday present after almost a year of working 40 hours at Starbucks, though they claim I was just a part-time employee, and after finally graduating high school during a miserable time around my life. Having just recently received a credit card, I decided to buy myself a plane ticket after clicking on an article about South Korea opening up its borders for tourism. Now I was already familiar with the South Korean culture and language through my Korean friends, and my students (I was an online English tutor for a while).
